CSS 342: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics
**Program 3: Linked Lists**

This programming assignment will require the usage of dynamic memory, pointers and linked
lists. It will also require the usage of File IO and templates. Also, required is a good
understanding of overloading assignment and copy constructors. Learnings from previous
assignments, especially operator overloading will also be required.

**Problem: The List.**
You will build a class for a fully ordered list. The list class, called List342, will be templatized so
that different types of objects can be stored in it.
List342<string> some_strings;
List342<int> list_of_integers;
List342<Child> children;
List342<MyRandomObj> ordered_list_random_objs;
